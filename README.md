# episodes
expression/entertainment/animated series

## unhiding

- people choose programming because it lets us hide, be voiceless - survive via craft
- but it is unhealthy - not the programs, but the culture of being silent for sefety
- the reason I program is to create a lacking type of game, have events, compete and communicate with others
- but the fucking "how.. this possible?" "how .. that, possible?" allows concerns to lead, instead of will/meaning/value
- the commitment should come first, the how gets figured out

## building in silence

- I find myself building the system alone, in silence
- but: there is a ocean of emotions, stories, concerns that are happening, both factually and abstract
- the journey - as a human being, the story, not commit history - gets lost
- but worse - you have no way to sahre emotions, thoughts, experience with others, so you boil in solitude
- blog? blogs are either sphere-specific (e.g. prorgamming) or boring, you hardly can share a blog with anyone

## voice, cotent for everyone, not just your own sphere

- there needs to be conent that can be consumed by everyone: the emotional/process part of the experience, with details abstracted away/simplified
- with saltiness, humour, failures, humility and naiveness, not "right" but fun
- should be dynamic, 5-10 mins (but format can change), so you could share the story
- can invite other people as guests to do the voice over for characters (there probably should be characters)
- humour inspiration can be drawn from Top Gear, Peter Jackson's humour in Middleearth, Star Wars, better part of South Park etc.

## isn't programming a system, along with tools *and* creating episodes too much, over-extension? 

- on the contrary:
    - it's like the number of wheels of a vehicle: one is the smallest, but least stable. 4 is *4 times more* but you get the car and can travel
    - can a car have less, 3 wheels? yes, but is makes a car unstable, it can roll over like a Reliant Robin
    - creating episodes is voice, expression, somehting for everyone to consume
    - that makes the jouney balanced: building (silence, process) and episodes (voice, expression, for everyone)
    - building systems is an adventure, a core material for the episodes
    - it's like internet and content, hardware and operating system, game and players: make sense as a combo
- the content needs to have meaning, value, saltiness, real emotion - it needs real process behind
- real process needs a humane, sincere outlet, expression, non-specific, abstract, for anyone to watch, enjoy, contemplate, discuss
