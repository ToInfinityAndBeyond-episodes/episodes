# episodes

- animated series to talk about process/emotions/thoughts behind the projects' journey, via abstractions, so it is fun and fresh and understandable to anyone, not just some cricle

## writing vs making the first epsiode

- making the first episode is the first step
- because the end goal is being able to periodically (but without schedule) create episodes, as points in value
- so instead of store-writing, go for the complete first step: the first epsiode

## series sketch vs series, inviting artist, personalities

- one person can crete series sketch (single voice over with a certain programmable animation)
- then, guest artists and personlaities may be invited to do real art (drawing) and rich voice over 
- as a base, within series sketch: the episode should tell the story (best way possible using the tools) and one voice
- so it should be watchable, understable, interesting and even enjoyble
- it may be an animated/voiced story-board, comic, animated series roughly programmed/drawn

## using programming library to create animated series

- it should be an existing java/javascript (js probably) library that has a ton of api to create characters, objects
- so episode is code
- episode should be buildable/runnable from source as a graphical program (on html canvas for example)
- then to video

## animation of characters, objects with a degree of randomness

- so make it more watchable and less artificial, if api has corresponding args, drawings should be slightly randomized
- so it is possible to program the animation, but it is rendered slighly different from frame to frame
- it is not critical, depends on tools
- story, voice, epsiode directing is the key - in other words, meaning - tools  are secondary, but would be nice

## b-roll

- as a separate video or after the episode, show (web cam recording) of how the episode was voiced over or programmed etc.
- so that no hiding

## write first epsisode, then tooling

- first step, write first episode, then check out tooling
